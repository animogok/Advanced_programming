#### How it works?

Well it's simple, the user starts the CLI app, it gives the user a serie of options that he will interact with, then he should

press any key from 1 to 6. When he press any key from that range, the application will pop up any other part depending on the

user selection, beeing from the catalog visualization to the reviews visualization and receip generator

So in the main part it works by simple key commands beeing the most only numbers, that the application intend to drive the user

to the desired part of the application.
